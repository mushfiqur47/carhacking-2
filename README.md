# Towards the Prevention of Car Hacking: A Threat to Automation Industry

Connectivity provides a safer environment, but it also acts as a backbone to provide attack surface to hackers. There are millions of cars on the road today, and so many are expected to be in future; there might be a risk to the passengers, vehicle drivers, etc. Methods/statistical analysis: This study discusses the issue of car hacking which is one of the real threats to automobile as well as automation, and how we can prevent it by studying the details about the controller area network (CAN) bus architecture so that the auto manufacturer gives more emphasis to developing a secure vehicular information system. Findings: Hackers gain access to the car system via the internet, Bluetooth, etc. As much as a car is automated, it is much more vulnerable to cyber-attack. When a car is connected to the internet, it provides access to the vehicleâ€™s delicate CAN bus. Hackers can hijack non-safety and safety-critical functions such as steering, accelerator, brake and clutches by sending commands. Improvements/applications: This study gives a general overview of how we can validate the security features of the vehicle so that we can secure our vehicle from black hat hackers, resulting in saving millions of people who could be a victim of such menacing cyber-attacks.
